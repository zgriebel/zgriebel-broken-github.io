I am a recent Computational Data Science and Physics graduate from Hamline University in St. Paul. I am a passionate and creative data scientist along with a charismatic leader who loves to learn. I have 2.5 years of [internship and research experience](https://zgriebel.github.io/Experience/) in data science and software development where I made significant contributions to my organizations.

**Personal -** I enjoy being outdoors, trying new things, and am unfortunately a die hard Minnesota sports fan.
