I am a recent Computational Data Science and Physics graduate from Hamline University in St. Paul. I am a passionate and creative data scientist along with a charismatic [leader](https://zgriebel.github.io/Awards_and_Achievements/) who loves to learn. I have 2.5 years of internship and research [experience](https://zgriebel.github.io/Experience/) with data science and software development, where I made significant contributions to each organization I have been apart of.

Personal - I enjoy being outdoors, traveling, and am unfortunately a die hard Minnesota sports fan.
