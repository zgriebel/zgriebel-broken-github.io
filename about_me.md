I am a recent Computational Data Science and Physics graduate from Hamline University in St. Paul. I am a passionate and creative data scientist along with a charismatic leader who loves to learn. I have 2.5 years of [internship and research experience](https://zgriebel.github.io/Experience/) with data science and software development where my skill set has made significant contributions to each organization.

Personal - I enjoy being outdoors, traveling, and am unfortunately a die hard Minnesota sports fan.
