I am a recent Computational Data Science and Physics graduate from Hamline University in St. Paul. I am a passionate and creative data scientist along with a charismatic [leader](https://zgriebel.github.io/Awards_and_Achievements/) who loves to learn. I have [experience](https://zgriebel.github.io/Experience/) as a researcher and intern within data science and software development since 2021. Where I have became a peer reviewed published lead [author](https://www.tridhascholars.org/pdfs/a-pilot-study-for-at-home-measurement-of-grip-strength-via-telemedicine-JOCCR-6-S11-1063.pdf) and made significant contributions to each organization I have been apart of.

Personal - I enjoy being outdoors, traveling, and am unfortunately a die hard Minnesota sports fan.
