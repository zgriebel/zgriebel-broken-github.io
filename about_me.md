![](Electron Microscope-169.jpg)
I am a recent Computational Data Science and Physics graduate from Hamline University in St. Paul. I am a passionate and creative data scientist along with a charismatic leader who loves to learn. I have 2.5 years of internship and research experience in data science and software development where I made significant contributions to my organizations.

Personal - I enjoy being outdoors, trying new things, and am unfortunately a die hard Minnesota sports fan.
